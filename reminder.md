- Your project must compile and work. Please include a README file for any special installs, docker images, etc. that we’ll need to run
- Don’t hardcode things that should be configurable
- Data structures are important.
- Think about how the application would organically grow overtime. Consider how the defined conversation in the project could change over time.
- Use SOLID object-oriented design.
- Provide at least one unit test for a core part of the project
- If you think a requirement is missing or incongruent, please contact us and ask us to clarify.
- Use logging

- Functionally correct code-   
- Test cases- Do you have unit tests and functional tests? (This is a must) 
- Code design- Did you decompose your code? Do you have proper classes?  Is your code readable?  Is your code packaged correctly (files organization) 
- Websocket integration  
- Coherent set of packages within the application 
- Hardcoded responses….a big no-no for us. We want to see conversations extensible and sustainable without requiring a recompile. 
- Read me instructions-  Have a solid readme file.  Please include high-level overview of what your code is doing in readme file.
